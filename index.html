              <p class="lead ">Hello! I’m Andy.</p>
              <p class="lead">Probably like you, I'm that person always embarking on creative adventures.  “Adventures” is really the only way to describe it. When I’m starting a new painting, it feels like I’m rappelling down an Indiana Jones-style cave with abstract arrows shooting out the wall, colors coalescing into trap doors, and ideas leading me to dead ends or bizarre holy grails.</p>
              <img class= "img-fluid" src="content/ezgif.com-gif-maker (13).gif" alt="painting proces gif"/>
              <p class="lead ">My creative practice is all about following my curiosity, imagination, and wonder, regardless of where it takes me. Last year, it took a turn that I did not expect, but one which I’d been secretly yearning for since I was a kid. I used to gut old radios and clocks to admire the beautiful and mysterious electronics inside. Technology fascinated me, but understanding it seemed like an unattainable dream, a project for left-brainers. But when my uncle showed me the <a class="mynavlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino</a> he bought for my little cousin, it reignited my curiosity and I bought one for myself, figuring that if a child could do it, so could I. Here is my first project completed in January 2021:</p>
                
              

            
              
              <img class="img-fluid" src="content/firstTechProject.gif" alt="first arduino led project"/>
              <p class="lead">Even though my prepubescent cousin was building cooler things with his Arduino, I was amazed that I'd just understood and built something which used to seem so esoteric. Exploring technology was a similar experience to painting; the more techniques I learned, the more the creative potential unlocked. My Arduino kit came with a <a class="mynavlink" href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/abdularbi17/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04-with-arduino-tutorial-327ff6">sensor</a> measuring distance by the speed of sound, and I realized I could use the distance of my hand to control an RGB LED. I finished the project in July 2021. As you can tell by my shirtlessness and the adoring look on my face, I was very close with my “Pet Rainbow” :</p>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="content/secondArduinoproject.gif" alt="first arduino led project"/>
              <p class="lead">My love for hardware was growing as fast as my love for software. I learned Python and how to use a machine learning library called OpenCV for tracking hand and body position. Watching my webcam track my fingertips made me wonder if I could use this new and improved data source to transform Pet Rainbow into a dance partner. The idea has spawned an adventure that continues to enchant and challenge me, and evokes the entire range of human emotions, from weeping-on-my-keyboard levels of burnout to direct-contact-with-god moments of revelation. Here is a maxed-out version of Pet Rainbow in March 2022:</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="content/lightbender.gif" alt="first arduino led project" height="450"/>
        
              <p class="lead"><a class="mynavlink" href="https://github.com/andyKlenzman/PetRainbowCom">A Python program</a> sends my hand coordinates to an ESP32 microcontroller running <a class="mynavlink" href="https://github.com/andyKlenzman/PetRainbowOrgans">a C++ program</a>, which uses math to translate coordinate data into wild patterns, then pushes them out realtime to a 150 RGB SK9822 LED strip. Pet Rainbow and I will be doing our first live performance in March 2022, so we are training hard to pull off some new tricks.</p>
   

              <p class="lead ">Current features include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="lead">One hand / two hand / full body data capture</li>
                <li class="lead">Recording and replaying light shows for sharing with friends and complimenting the music you were dancing to</li>
                <li class="lead">Selections for different light patterns, control dynamics, and color palettes</li>
                <li class="lead">Data manipulation for analyzing, editing, and enhancing light shows</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="lead ">I’m working on more editing and layering options so you can craft lightshows with controls similar to a music looper, except the interface is controlled by dance rather than a pedal. I’d also like to turn Pet Rainbow into a web and <a class="mynavlink" href="https://github.com/andyKlenzman/Light-Camera-Action">iOS app</a> capable of 1) capturing and streaming data wirelessly and 2) social media features for sharing light shows with other LED strips. Everyone I know is getting a Pet Rainbow for Christmas, so my goal is to finish the project by the end of the year.</p>

              <p class="lead ">Gutting radios and playing with LEDs has spawned so many new interests. If you mapped them out, the terrain would look like a giant tree branching into more trees. It would be too long of a post to explain all of them, so here is a list of my technology-inspired projects from January 2021, with some visuals and links to GitHub and sources of inspiration:
              </p>
              <ul>

                <li class="lead mymargin">Social media platforms with Firebase and Angular (inspiration to build with social media comes from my international friend Ben who writes the blog <a class="mynavlink" href="https://tinyprojects.dev/">Tiny Projects</a>. He created an awesome social media website called <a class="mynavlink" href="https://snormal.com/">sNormal</a></li>

                <li class="lead mymargin"><a class="mynavlink" href="https://github.com/andyKlenzman/Light-Camera-Action">iOS Apps</a> with Swift: besides building more Pet Rainbow features, I’d like to build an app called Quote Collector for collecting, sharing, and receiving quotes of inspiration</li>

                <li class="lead"><a class="mynavlink" href="https://github.com/andyKlenzman/Two-Handed-Pong">Data Science</a> with Numpy Pandas/Python (Data science is surprisingly creative, most of Pet Rainbow is designing and analyzing data structures)</li>

              </ul>
           
              <p class="lead ">The past year has shown me what’s possible when curiosity, imagination and wonder are your guides. Even though I had no clue where they were taking me, giving up control allowed for experiences, passions, and connections I never expected. I hope to finish Pet Rainbow and share it with the world, whether that’s in the form of gifts, performances, or an online business. I have plans to do some VJ sets, which is terrifying but also awesome. I’m interested in new ideas and collaboration, so if you want to connect, I would love to hear from you.

                <p class="lead">Happy Trails!</p>

                <p class="lead">UPDATE:</p>
                <p class="lead">Pet Rainbow and I did our first live performance on March 28th, 2022 at a talent show. The original plan was to improvise a lightshow with a song played over the speaker. Instead, we collaborated with a singer at the show who had auditioned on America's Got Talent and was absolutely incredible. Here is a video of the performance: </p>
